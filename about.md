### Alt text by Taeyoon Choi 


### This website contains paintings by Taeyoon Choi and ekphrastic collaborations with his friends, poets and writers. Collaborators were invited to creatively interpret the paintings. This website is designed with accessibility for the Blind and visually impaired audience in mind. The website also contains Alt-Text with visual interpretation of the paintings. The website was inspired by <a href="https://shannonfinnegan.com/alt-text-as-poetry"> Alt-Text as Poetry</a>  workshop by Shannon Finnegan. The website was designed and developed by <a href="http://ritu.online/" target="_blank">Ritu Ghiya</a> in 2019. For code, please visit the project repository.
