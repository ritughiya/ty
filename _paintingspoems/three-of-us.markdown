by Xuan Juliana Wang
The three of us, we were walking around looking to refill our glasses. The music was loud and there were not enough places to sit so everyone started to just lay down on the floor. I stumbled upon you within a circle of blank faces listening to someone tell a somber story, we could tell from the mood. But watching your face there, watching your eyes, you looked like someone on the cusp of change. And I loved you so much, I loved you objectively, the way we know by instinct to love every hero at the beginning of their adventure."
