For the elders
by Jessica Lynne
I remember how the elders would praise their god:
Ye, though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
we will fear no evil
for you are with us
I too have learned how to give thanks to the spirits who guide me:
for the hazy sunsets of orange and yellow and pink that swallow my fear
a quiet that reminds me I am never alone
for the large droplets of rain that cool my angst
always arriving in three, a holy descent
for fertile brown earth that steadies my way
along a path unknown
for the elders, who first taught me how to pray"
