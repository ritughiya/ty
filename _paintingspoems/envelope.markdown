Envelope
by Everest Pipkin
i have mailed you
this close up of a person’s face
a parent with children all about
during the u.s. winter


i have done this
because i want to be outstanding
dearer
material and remote


to talk
soft like mammals
over long distances
with someone in tears 

the sun shone in their faces
a lot of smiles
a neck held tightly
voice trained open


the opening of an envelope
they envelope
