# Envelope
## by Everest Pipkin

i have mailed you  <br>
this close up of a personâ€™s face <br>
a parent with children all about<br>
during the u.s. winter<br>
<br>
i have done this<br>
because i want to be outstanding<br>
dearer<br>
material and remote<br>
<!--more-->
<br>
to talk<br>
soft like mammals<br>
over long distances<br>
with someone in tears<br>
<br>
the sun shone in their faces<br>
a lot of smiles<br>
a neck held tightly<br>
voice trained open<br>
<br>
the opening of an envelope<br>
they envelope<br>
<br>
